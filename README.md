## SACN Scene Recorder

ðŸ’¡ This web application is used to record sACN scenes and play them back using HTP merge. Features:

-   Unlimited number of scenes.
-   Scenes can be renamed, color-coded, categorized and reordered.
-   Faders can be enabled on a per-scene basis.
-   Per-scene fade time.
-   Sinus wave generator with shuffled offsets for each channel.
-   Multiple universes.
-   Control via Website UI, WebSockets or MQTT. BitFocus companion (including feedback) is supported via WebSockets.

The project uses Next.js, but with a custom Express.js server to enable the sACN, WebSockets, and MQTT services to run simultaneously. Tailwind is used for styling. State in the back end is managed through redux and stored in a sqlite3 database.
